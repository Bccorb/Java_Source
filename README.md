Practice_Repo
=============

My first Repository

This started as merely a practice for myself to become familiar with GITHUB and GIT. 

Currently in this Repo is java projects I have worked on. Most are well commented and function correctly. 

Feel free to fork and use for your school assignments or just for show and I will listen to any suggestions
on the best coding practices.

Thank you.
